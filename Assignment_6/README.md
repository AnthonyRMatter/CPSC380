## Assignment: Assignment 6 -- Virtual Address Manager

### Files: vmmgr.c, addresses.txt, BACKING_STORE.bin
### Errors: When we print out the physical address, if we print it using lu for long unsigned it, then my machine works fine, but Viola's machine gets a warning. However, if we use llu for long long unsigned int, Viola's machine works fine but mine gets a warning.
